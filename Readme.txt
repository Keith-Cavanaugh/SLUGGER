SLUGGGER

	In Slugger © you must make the perilous journey through Danger Highway and the Sea of Salt to rest safely atop your home leaf. You only have one life and must make it on all 3 leaves. Your slug even realistically leaves slime wherever he goes!

	Use the arrow keys to move Mr. Slugger and hit select to restart. Avoid the trucks and use the log to make it to the leaves. Try and reach the end to become a Slugger Master!
